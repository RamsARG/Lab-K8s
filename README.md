Kubernetes cluster on Proxmox VE using Terraform
 
The idea with is to have a Kubernetes cluster for learning and testing purposes, as I can't afford a managed cluster in the cloud. One of the solutions is to take advantage that I have a home lab with Proxmox VE enough to be able to apply some Terraform and other tools.
